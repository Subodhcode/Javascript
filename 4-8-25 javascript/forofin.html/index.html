        /*Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a specified condition is met.
        It is used to work with collections like arrays, objects, or strings and to avoid writing repetitive code.
        Common iteration methods include for, while, for...of, and for...in.
        
        Iterate means to go through elements of a collection one by one and perform an operation on each element until all elements are processed or a condition is met.*/
